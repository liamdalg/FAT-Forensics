# FAT-Forensics

FAT-Forensics is a python package which investigates the **F**airness, **A**ccountability, and **T**ransparency of predictive algorithms. FAT is targeted at academic researchers, ML enthusiasts, and developers who will use it to easily investigate the social aspect of their predictive models. 

This is the front and back end for a web application which will connect to FAT. It can load datasets into a database, retrieve existing datasets, display and compare data points, generate metrics which evaluate ML fairness, accountability, and transparency metrics, provide interactive plots, and export these reports into PDFs.

The core FAT package was developed by researchers at The University of Bristol, with sponsorship from Thales UK.
