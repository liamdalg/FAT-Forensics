# Overview
The core FAT package was developed by researchers at the University of Bristol, with sponsorship from Thales UK. 

Our client would like to work with us to investigates the Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency (FAT) of predictive algorithms. This is the front and back end for a web application which will connect to FAT. It can load datasets into a database, retrieve existing datasets, display and compare data points, generate metrics which evaluate ML fairness, accountability, and transparency metrics, provide interactive plots, and export these reports into PDFs.

Our goal is to democratise assessing social aspects and potentially detrimental effects of predictive models by providing an open source Python package licensed under BSD3 with easy to use Application Programming Interface (API) and minimal dependencies (SciPy and Numpy). The package is intended to be easily integrable with scikit-learn: the most popular and leading open source Python package for doing ML. With the abundance of novel FAT methods, a common open source framework could lower the entry barrier to this research field. Just like scikit-learn allows non-experts to fiddle around with state-of-the-art ML algorithms, we hope that the software framework that is the outcome of our research could allow a broader AI community and lay ML users to test and evaluate their algorithms for security issues, biases, discriminations and unexpected behaviour.

Our key problem is that this is a back- and front-ends package and we have to work alongside AI and ML to create a user-facing interface that can potentially impact how research in AI fairness, accountability and transparency is done. After further discussion, we concluded to.....
