        <h1 id="overview">Overview</h1>
<p>The core FAT package was developed by researchers at the University of Bristol, with sponsorship from Thales UK.</p>
<p>Our client would like to work with us to investigates the Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency (FAT) of predictive algorithms. This is the front and back end for a web application which will connect to FAT. It can load datasets into a database, retrieve existing datasets, display and compare data points, generate metrics which evaluate ML fairness, accountability, and transparency metrics, provide interactive plots, and export these reports into PDFs.</p>
<p>Our goal is to democratise assessing social aspects and potentially detrimental effects of predictive models by providing an open source Python package licensed under BSD3 with easy to use Application Programming Interface (API) and minimal dependencies (SciPy and Numpy). The package is intended to be easily integrable with scikit-learn: the most popular and leading open source Python package for doing ML. With the abundance of novel FAT methods, a common open source framework could lower the entry barrier to this research field. Just like scikit-learn allows non-experts to fiddle around with state-of-the-art ML algorithms, we hope that the software framework that is the outcome of our research could allow a broader AI community and lay ML users to test and evaluate their algorithms for security issues, biases, discriminations and unexpected behaviour.</p>
<p>Our key problem is that this is a back- and front-ends package and we have to work alongside AI and ML to create a user-facing interface that can potentially impact how research in AI fairness, accountability and transparency is done. After further discussion, we concluded to.....</p>
<h1 id="requirements">Requirements</h1>
<p>Stakeholders:</p>
<p>The foremost stakeholders are the academic researchers, ML enthusiasts and developers who will use it to easily assess and investigate social aspect of their predictive models.</p>
<p>#Functional Requirements
The goal of the project is for researchers to easily assess and investigate social aspect of their predictive models.</p>
<ol>
<li>Researchers should be able to upload their own datasets from a folder.</li>
<li>Researchers should be able to create a new file and implement dataset.</li>
<li>Researchers should be able to write a name, id and description for the data</li>
<li>Researchers should be able to add and delete any data.</li>
<li>The system should be able to load datasets into database and retrieve existing datasets.</li>
<li>The system should be able to display and compare data points and generate metrics which evaluate ML fairness, accountability, transparency metrics and provide interactive plots</li>
<li>The system should be able to export reports into PDFs.</li>
<li>There should be some guides on the interface so user can understand how to use our website and what can each button do.</li>
<li></li>
<li></li>
<li></li>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>#Non-Functional Requirements</p>
<p>It should have a user-friendly interface. Google have released a plugin called &quot;what-if tool&quot;, for their TensorFlow visualisation framework called TensorBoard. It is similar with our project but it has a limitation of interacting only with TensorFlow models. We want to have larger audience and higher impact so we are making our project clear to use and the overall design should be simple but professional.</p>
<p>Since we have lots of graphs and data appear on our interface and our user would mainly choose to use a tablet for this, we won't implement a smartphone version for the project.</p>
<p>The project should be able to be updated or changed to meet client's requirements.</p>
<p>The system can only be changed by the admins of the project and all the data must be kept safe so they are not suspected, or disputed.</p>
<p>The size of the project cannot be too large because we don't want it to be super slow when we load data. We should compress and tidy our code to minimise loading time.</p>

<h2 id="high-level">High-Level</h2>
<h2 id="database">Database</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Why not SQLite/any other alternative?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Heroku uses an <em>ephemeral filesystem</em><sup>1</sup> (i.e. any files written are deleted the moment the dyno is stopped/restarted). This makes SQLite unsuitable as it works on memory and you'd lose your database every 24 hours or so, as opposed to Postgres which works over multiple dynos.</p>
<p>In addition, Heroku also has great support for Postgres.</p>
<h2 id="orm">ORM</h2>
<h2 id="flask">Flask</h2>
<ul>
<li>lightweight</li>
<li>don't want full stack</li>
<li>use extensions for precisely what we want</li>
<li>our actual website isn't large</li>
<li>lot to learn - flask easier</li>
<li>no bogging down</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="orm-1">ORM</h2>
<p>We decied to use an ORM because they manage the SQL driver for us, which means that we don't need to deal with driver specific syntax and types. Using an ORM also means that we don't have to write any SQL, making our system more secure, and there's a one-to-one mapping between the data in our program and the data stored in the database. We chose <strong>SQLAlchemy</strong> over other ORMs since it has a nice binding with Flask in a package called <strong>Flask-SQLAlchemy</strong>.</p>
<p>For example, here's the model which represents the <strong>Graph</strong> table in the database:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"><div><span class="hljs-comment"># models.py</span>

db = SQLAlchemy()

<span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title">Graph</span><span class="hljs-params">(db.Model)</span>:</span>
    graph_id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=<span class="hljs-keyword">True</span>)
    type = db.Column(db.Integer, nullable=<span class="hljs-keyword">False</span>)
    name = db.Column(db.String, nullable=<span class="hljs-keyword">False</span>)
    dataset = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey(<span class="hljs-string">'dataset.dataset_id'</span>))
    data = db.Column(db.JSON, nullable=<span class="hljs-keyword">False</span>)
</div></code></pre>
<h2 id="graph-library">Graph Library</h2>
<p>Our graphs are powered by <strong>Cytoscape.js</strong>, a frontend library for generating graph networks. Cytoscape boasts great features such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cross-platform using HTML canvas.</li>
<li>Native exporting to JSON so the user can save or download the graph.</li>
<li>Large extension pool and easily modifiable.</li>
<li>Automatic layouts, meaning we don't have do manually define the position of each node.</li>
<li>Customisable events on each part of the graph.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cytoscape renders on the frontend using a HTML canvas, which does mean that we rely on the library either being lightweight or the user having sufficient hardware to run it. Since the tool is research-oriented, our client told us to only target the desktop platform and ignore mobile/tablet users, which means that most if not all of our users can run Cytoscape. We tested other libraries such as <strong>Sigma.js</strong>, but found that it both runs worse than Cytoscape and lends itself more to densely connected networks rather than a directed graph structure.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Cytoscape is a large library (1MB+ including other extensions) which could negatively affect the load times of the page. In 2016, the average website had an average script size of 357kb<sup>2</sup>, so we plan to reduce the size of our scripts by using compression and a build tool to bundle the scripts together.</p>

<h1 id="testing">Testing</h1>
<h2 id="backend">Backend</h2>
<p>Our backend runs <strong>Flask</strong>, which uses Python. To test this, we use:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pytest</strong> (to test specific assertions)</li>
<li><strong>Pylint</strong>; (to test if the program compiles, and if a consistent coding style is used)</li>
</ul>
<p>A <strong>database</strong> (PostgreSQL) is used alongside Flask, which is also primitively tested (insertion/deletion/format of data).</p>
<h2 id="frontend">Frontend</h2>
<p>The frontend is mostly <strong>JS</strong>. There are a few aspects which we can test:</p>
<p>We run <strong>Selenium</strong> on CircleCI to test the usability of the site - it can simulate button activations.</p>
<p>Using <strong>Jest</strong>, we write some unit tests for the graph library we use, <strong>INSERT</strong>. These verify that basic functionality works (i.e. adding/deleting nodes).</p>
<p>We could test how the site looks, but we decided against it since changes to the UI are often and sometimes very slight, making it difficult to keep the tests current.</p>
<h2 id="testing-workflow">Testing Workflow</h2>
<p>In all, our testing workflow relies on:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Local</strong> user testing</li>
<li>Tests ran on <strong>CircleCI</strong> (during which: all python modules are reinstalled; the database is reset (i.e. a 'clean slate'))</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="file:///home/adam/Documents/Code/Uni/SPE/FAT-Forensics/portfolio-a/assets/testing-workflow.png" alt="Testing Workflow"></p>
<p>This assures us that our code works on more than just one machine.</p>
<h3 id="why-circleci">Why CircleCI?</h3>
<p>We looked at different methods of CI and decided on CircleCI because of its <strong>ease of use</strong> and <strong>speed of setup</strong>. We found that <strong>Jenkins</strong> took a lot of setup, including hosting it on our own server, wheras with CircleCI we can operate cloud-based on their servers. <strong>TravisCI</strong> was another contender but ultimately we wanted the ability to deploy our site to Heroku all in one platform.</p>
<p>TODO:</p>
<p>[] Integration tests?
[] Change tense?</p>
