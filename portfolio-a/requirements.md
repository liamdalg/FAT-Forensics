# Requirements
Stakeholders: 

The foremost stakeholders are the academic researchers, ML enthusiasts and developers who will use it to easily assess and investigate social aspect of their predictive models.


#Functional Requirements
The goal of the project is for researchers to easily assess and investigate social aspect of their predictive models.

1. Researchers should be able to upload their own datasets from a folder.
2. Researchers should be able to create a new file and implement dataset.
3. Researchers should be able to write a name, id and description for the data
4. Researchers should be able to add and delete any data.
5. The system should be able to load datasets into database and retrieve existing datasets.
6. The system should be able to display and compare data points and generate metrics which evaluate ML fairness, accountability, transparency metrics and provide interactive plots
7. The system should be able to export reports into PDFs.
8. There should be some guides on the interface so user can understand how to use our website and what can each button do.

#Non-Functional Requirements

It should have a user-friendly interface. Google have released a plugin called "what-if tool", for their TensorFlow visualisation framework called TensorBoard. It is similar with our project but it has a limitation of interacting only with TensorFlow models. We want to have larger audience and higher impact so we are making our project clear to use and the overall design should be simple but professional.

Since we have lots of graphs and data appear on our interface and our user would mainly choose to use a tablet for this, we won't implement a smartphone version for the project.

The project should be able to be updated or changed to meet client's requirements.

The system can only be changed by the admins of the project and all the data must be kept safe so they are not suspected, or disputed.

The size of the project cannot be too large because we don't want it to be super slow when we load data. We should compress and tidy our code to minimise loading time.
